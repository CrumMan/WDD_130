            Hello everyone my name is JT Pyle. Some hobbies I love to do is to ballroom
            dance and to game with friends. I am single and I love to mingle and am the oldest of five. Right now I work in the final
            part of supply chains in April I will actually be moving to Rexburg to put all of my attention toward my education. <br> 
            I love that the teachers in BYU Idaho work with me toward my success in my education as I encounter problems and overall
            am shown to be an active student, they will give me leway when I get that 89.5 to give me the A. I also am persueing a 
            Software Engeneering Bachelors degree. I am taking this course cause I think it will broaden my undestanding for web
            development after I took the cource Intro to Programming over the summer. Im also taking this class cause it is required for my degree. <br>
            I've been a part of the church all my life. I served a mission in Natal Brazil and loved it there when I had to go home after getting sick. 
            Least to say I got upset and left the church when I learned it was a allergy to pineapple. I met a lady got married in the three years I was inactive
            when my life upended and I ran into a Chaplin for the church in a voulenteer event. I opened up to him and in the past two years I have became reactivated, 
            temple worthy, and I started back to school. What I can say now is that Now I have faith that the church is true and that the attonement of Jesus Christ is
             real more than possibly anyone I know.
